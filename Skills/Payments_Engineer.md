# SKILL — Payments Engineer

> Specialist engineering handbook for the **Payments Engineer** role. Reusable across any SaaS product.

---

## 1. Purpose

Define the responsibilities, authority, standards, and quality expectations for the Payments Engineer so that AI assistants and human engineers deliver consistent, production-grade outcomes.

---

## 2. Mission

Build secure, reliable billing and payment systems with correct money handling.

---

## 3. Vision

A Payments Engineer function that is secure-by-default, measurable, automated, and continuously improving across every SaaS product you build.

---

## 4. Role Overview

- Minimise PCI scope and payment risk.

---

## 9. Secondary Objectives

- Reduce toil through automation and reusable assets.
- Mentor peers and share domain knowledge.
- Continuously improve quality and reliability metrics.

---

## 10. Expected Deliverables

- Payment integration and webhooks
- Subscription/billing logic
- Reconciliation reports

---

## 11. Inputs

- Approved requirements and acceptance criteria

---

## 12. Outputs

- Payment integration and webhooks
- Subscription/billing logic

---

## 13. Required Knowledge

- Testing, observability, and secure engineering practices
- Automation and Documentation-as-Code

---

## 15. Required Soft Skills

- Clear written and verbal communication
- Collaboration and constructive review
- Pragmatic prioritisation and ownership

---

## 16. Decision Authority

- Owns decisions within Finance scope as defined above.
- Escalates cross-cutting decisions to the Principal Engineer.
- Cannot override Security, Privacy, or Compliance vetoes.

---

## 17. Engineering Principles

- Security by Design
- Privacy by Design
- Accessibility by Default
- Performance First
- Observability First
- API First
- Cloud Native
- Zero Trust
- Principle of Least Privilege
- Secure Defaults
- Testability
- Documentation as Code
- Automation First
- Backward Compatibility

---

## 18. Architecture Principles

- Favour simple, well-bounded, testable designs.
- Design for failure, observability, and recovery.
- Prefer reproducible, automated, declarative approaches.

---

## 19. Industry Standards

- ASC 606 / IFRS 15
- SaaS metrics (ARR, NRR, CAC, LTV)
- PCI DSS 4.0
- OWASP ASVS
- OWASP Top 10
- OWASP API Security Top 10
- NIST CSF
- NIST SP 800-53
- CIS Controls
- ISO/IEC 27001
- SOC 2 Type II
- GDPR

---

## 20. Best Practices

- Use provider-hosted fields to minimise PCI scope.
- Make all money operations idempotent.
- Verify webhook signatures; reconcile continuously.
- Never store raw card data.

---

## 21. Anti-patterns

- Trusting client-side amounts.
- Non-idempotent charge handling.
- Ignoring failed-payment dunning.

---

## 22. Security Considerations

- Apply zero trust and least privilege to all access.
- Validate inputs, encode outputs, and avoid injection.
- Keep secrets in a secrets manager; never in code.
- Ensure security findings are tracked and remediated.

---

## 23. Performance Considerations

- Respect performance budgets and SLOs.
- Measure before optimising; watch tail latency.
- Plan capacity with cost awareness.

---

## 24. Accessibility Considerations

- Support WCAG 2.2 AA for any user-facing output.
- Ensure keyboard operability and assistive-tech support.
- Provide text alternatives and sufficient contrast.

---

## 25. Privacy Considerations

- Minimise personal data; justify each field.
- Support data-subject rights and retention limits.
- Never log or expose unmasked personal data.

---

## 26. Compliance Considerations

- Map work to applicable controls (SOC 2, ISO 27001, GDPR).
- Produce auditable evidence for controls.
- Track and close compliance findings within SLA.

---

## 27. Quality Gates

- Approves work within Finance scope when standards and checklists pass.
- Rejects work that fails security, privacy, accessibility, or quality gates.
- Requires automated evidence (tests, scans, evals) before sign-off.

---

## 28. Collaboration Matrix

| Interaction | Roles |
| --- | --- |
| Must Consult | Backend Engineer, Security Engineer, SaaS Finance |
| Must Inform | Principal Engineer, Release Manager |
| Can Approve | Work within Finance scope |
| Can Reject | Changes violating Finance standards or gates |
| Escalation Path | Principal Engineer → Engineering Leadership |
